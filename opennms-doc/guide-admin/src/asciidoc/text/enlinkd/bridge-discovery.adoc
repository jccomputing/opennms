==== Bridge Discovery

The links from the bridge forwarding table elaborations needs a deep explanation.
First of all you should consider that the transparent bridge has only local map of the network:
it acts in such a manner, if I got a frame whose source mac address is for example `0aabb11ccdd` on port 10 then I put an entry in my table for that mac address on that port so that when I got a frame with destination mac address 00aabb11ccd` I know that I have to forward it on port 10.
Transparent bridging is not loop free so if you have loops you have to enable the spanning tree protocol that will detect loops and again will put some port in a state _blocking_ to avoid loops.
To get links you need to perform some calculations that let you find the links.
We can consider that mainly we have links between a workstation or server (identified by a mac address) and links between bridges.
We call them _macLink_ and the others _bridgeLink_.
A _bridgeLink_ is a _connection_ between backbone ports.
So we have written a code that is able to identify backbone ports and then able to associate mac address to the source port on source bridge where it was originally learned.
So you have to consider the following, at the end the algorithm is able to make an association of bridge port with a set of _source mac addresses_ as it understand that they are all connected to that port.
By the nature of the algorithm it is possible that we can have this set of mac addresses associated to more then one bridgeport: this is understable especially considering that we can "miss" a device in the middle.
In this case we save set of mac addresses for all the bridge port addressing to them.
So to get links you must first of all get the backbone links between bridges, these are saved into _bridgeBridgeLink_ table.

| _ipNetToMediaIfIndex_           | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.1`       | The interface on which this entry's equivalence is effective.
                                                                    The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of _ifIndex_.
| _ipNetToMediaPhysAddress_       | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.2`       | The media-dependent _physical_ address.
| _ipNetToMediaNetAddress_        | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.3`       | The _IpAddress_ corresponding to the media-dependent _physical_ address.
| _ipNetToMediaType_              | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.4`       | The type of mapping. Setting this object to the value _invalid(2)_ has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the _ipNetToMediaTable_.
                                                                    That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry.
                                                                    It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.
                                                                    Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use.
                                                                    Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant _ipNetToMediaType_ object.
